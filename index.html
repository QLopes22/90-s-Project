    <h1>What is the 'First Earth Battalion?</h1>
      

    <p>A secret unit called the First Earth Battalion was established by the US Army during the Cold War to determine if soldiers could become invisible, walk through walls, and stare at goats until the animals keeled over from a heart attack.

        "Animals!" General Albert Stubblebine III said while explaining his psychic training plans to US Special Forces commanders in 1983. "Stopping the hearts of animals. Bursting the hearts of animals!”
        
        The General’s outburst was met with stony silence. Stubblebine feared he’d gone too far. A year later, he retired early, convinced his bleating had come to nothing.</p>
    <p>It was an embarrassing moment; one Stubblebine was trying to forget when he was interviewed by Jonathan Ronson, author of The Men Who Stare at Goats (2004). Stubblebine recalled stumbling through the meeting and admitted he’d never accomplished his other psychic goals either, including walking through walls: "I simply kept bumping my nose... If you really want to know, it's a disappointment. Same with the levitation." What the General didn’t know was that America’s Green Berets were deadly serious about testing his goat idea. Just a few hundred yards down the road from where the Special Forces brass gathered that day, the US was housing 100 de-bleated goats - animals who could open and close their mouths without emitting a sound. The top-secret goats, forever sworn to silence, were used by the Green Berets in battle training exercises. If Americans could somehow learn to stare goats into the ground, they might be able to do the same with enemy forces.</p>

    <p>It seems General Stubblebine commanded a secret military psychic spying unit from 1981 to 1984 - basically six soldiers in a condemned building in Fort Meade, a Black Op that didn't officially exist.

        By the mid-1980s, however, Special Forces had undertaken a secret initiative to create 'super soldiers' - officers with superpowers who could walk into a room and be instantly aware of every detail, according to Glenn Wheaton Sergeant First Class, US Army and a retired military intelligence professional.
        
        Special Forces didn’t stop there, however. There were levels beyond ‘superpowers’ including heightened intuition and invisibility (although merely remaining unseen was acceptable) and, of course, there were the goat experiments. At least one intelligence officer had stopped a goat’s heart in a deadly stare-off at the military’s secret ‘Goat Lab’, Wheaton told Ronson.</p>

        <h2>The Goat Lab</h2>
    <p>‘The Goat Lab’ was part of the Special Warfare Center and School at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, where Green Berets shot goats in the leg and learned how to treat wounds, deal with trauma cases, and address other types of battlefield injuries.

        The progression to ‘goat staring’ was inspired by US Lieutenant Colonel Jim Channon, author of the First Earth Battalion Field Manual, who encouraged aspiring super soldiers to embrace their psychic powers. 
        
        Channon, a Vietnam war vet,  envisioned an Army full of 'Warrior Monks' who had the presence, service, and dedication of a monk, and the absolute skill and precision of a warrior.</p>
